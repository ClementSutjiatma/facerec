# Facerec - An Attendance Tracking Web App

Facerec leverages AWS Rekognition's facial recognition capabilities to create a webpage that allows students to 
confirm their attendance from their phones or laptops. Student simply needs to input their course number and take 
a selfie on the portal to confirm attendance. Facial recognition ensures that the student is a valid and enrolled member
of the class.
